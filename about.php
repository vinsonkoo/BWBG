			<p class="main_description">Black Women for Black Girls (BWBG) is a giving circle composed of black women from the greater New York area that support organizations, causes and initiatives that seek to enhance the lives of black girls throughout the five boroughs.</p>
 
			<p class="main_description">BWBG members pledge a financial contribution for a two-year period and collaborate to create significant grant-making opportunities. The grants issued by BWBG are issued to programs and organizations that have demonstrated both the ability and the capacity to improve the lives of black girls in the New York area.</p>
			 
			<p class="main_description">In addition, grant recipients must demonstrate that the programs for which they are being awarded funds make a tangible impact in the BWBG programmatic prongs, as determined by the study, "Black Girls in New York City: Untold Strength &amp; Resilience."</p>
			 
			<p class="main_description">The BWBG programmatic prongs are:
			Education | Safety &amp; Survival Skills | Self-Image &amp; Self Esteem | Faith, Family and Racial Identity as Protective Factors</p>
			 
			<p class="main_description">In addition to providing grants to qualified nonprofits, BWBG plans and executes its own <a href="#">signature program</a> every year.</p>

		<h2>Why is this giving circle important?</h2>

		<p>While there are many prominent girls advocacy and support groups in New York City and several organizations with a commitment to women and girls both locally and even nationally and internationally, none of these organizations has an explicit focus on black girls, nor do they call upon the resources of women who were once those girls: professional black women in the New York City metropolitan area.</p>

		<p>Black Women for Black Girls is changing that. It is a giving circle that calls upon black women to be leaders who will support their younger sisters as they try to attain life success in a difficult urban environment.</p>
